# Computer Vision for Fashion Matching


The topic I will be talking about is color recognition from images for use in fashion matching. Putting together a coordinating outfit may be challenging for people who are blind or visually impaired. This tutorial aims to provide assistance with the use of a mobile camera device to recognize the dominant colors of clothing items, as well as provide feedback to suggest other colors that may complement them. 

## Introduction and Problem Definition
Putting together coordinating outfits for various occasions or everyday wear can be challenging for people who are blind, colorblind, or visually imapired. They can overcome these challenges with the help from friends and family members, or by having descriptive Braille labels stitched onto clothing items. However, attaching labels to every clothing item is a lot of work and would require help from others, and people might not always be around to give suggestions. With the help of computer vision and a mobile device, this project aims to provide a quicker and easier solution to describe outfit colors and make recommendations.
