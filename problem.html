            <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 18px">Putting together coordinating outfits for various occasions or everyday wear can be a challenge for people who are blind, colorblind, or visually impaired. These challenges may be overcome with the help from friends and family members who can give clothing descriptions and suggestions, or through the use of descriptive Braille labels which can be stitched onto clothing items. However, attaching labels to every clothing item is a lot of work, may be expensive, and would require help from others to attach onto the items. Additionally, others might not always be around to help and to give suggestions. With the help of computer vision and a mobile device, this project aims to provide a quicker and easier solution to assist the visually impaired in identifying clothing items and making outfit recommendations.

Computer vision and deep learning utilization in the topic of fashion and apparel are still a very new and recent areas of research and study that have just emerged within the last decade. Upon researching such techniques in the topic of wardrobe assistance, I have found that deep learning can be used for the purposes of apparel classification - often for use in e-commerce websites - where systems are trained using large image databases of different types of clothing items and are often used to make clothing recommendations and advertisements. As such, these implementations are mostly catered to apparel companies. When it comes to clothing assistance for the blind and visually impaired, there is still much research to be done. Although there exist various implementations for identifying clothing patterns and colors, these often employ basic computer vision techniques, but often not machine learning.</p>
            <p style = "text-align: left; font-size: 18px">
However, with the combination of these different topics and aspects, it may be possible to implement an application that fulfills the goal in assisting the visually impaired in identifying and putting together outfits from their own personal wardrobes.
